        <h3>Transcribe Meeting Challenge</h3>
    </div>

    <p>Speech recognition technology continues to improve â€“ driven in part by natural language interfaces to computers such as Alexa, Siri, Google and Cortana.</p>
    <p>Could this technology be used to automatically transcribe meetings? This would be a great way to capture what was said and agreed at business meetings without the time-consuming process of writing up meeting minutes. It would be a real-time saver for businesses of all kinds.</p>
    <p>Attached below is the audio file you can use for transcribing, the challenge definition and sponsor presentation.</p>
