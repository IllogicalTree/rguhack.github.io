- title: What do I need to bring?
  text: >
    You'll need a laptop and charger. Don't have one? Get in touch and we'll see what we can arrange. Take a phone charger and any other cables you think you'll need. You should bring some warm and comfortable clothes as the hackathon can be a long 24 hours, and take a fresh set of clothes if you’d like to get changed. If you’d like to take a rest during the event, we’d also suggest taking a sleeping bag and/or pillow.

- title: Are there any COVID-19 restrictions?

    You'll need to comply with all current Scottish Government and Robert Gordon University venue rules at the time of the event. There is currently no requirement for a vaccine passport or equivalent. You may wish to carry out a test before the event for your own peace of mind and to protect others and we would encourage you to do so if that option is available to you.
