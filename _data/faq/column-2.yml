    You'll need a laptop and charger. Don't have one? Get in touch and we'll see what we can arrange. Take a phone charger and any other cables you think you will need. Bring some warm and comfortable clothes as the hackathon is long and maybe take a fresh set of clothes for the final presentations.

    You'll need to comply with all current Scottish Government and Robert Gordon University venue rules at the time of the event. There is currently no requirement for a vaccine passport or equivalent. You may wish to carry out a test before the event for your own peace of mind.
