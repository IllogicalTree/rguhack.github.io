    You'll need a laptop and charger. Don't have one? Get in touch and we'll see what we can arrange. Take a phone charger and any other cables you think you'll need. You should bring some warm and comfortable clothes as the hackathon can be a long 24 hours, and take a fresh set of clothes if you’d like to get changed. If you’d like to take a rest during the event, we’d also suggest taking a sleeping bag and/or pillow.
