    Yes! RGUHack is open to complete beginners and seasoned hackathon attendees! If you have never attended a hackathon before you won't be the only one, and you don't need to be studying a computing degree or have coding experience. It's all about learning something new, having fun and meeting others. There's lots of mentorship and tech support on hand throughout to help make your ideas a reality. Don't stress as many people will be on the same boat!

- title: What do I need to bring?

    You'll need a laptop and charger. Don't have one? Get in touch and we'll see what we can arrange. Take a phone charger and any other cables you think you'll need. You should bring some warm and comfortable clothes as the hackathon can be a long 24 hours, and take a fresh set of clothes if you’d like to get changed. If you’d like to take a rest during the event, we’d also suggest taking a sleeping bag and/or pillow.
